# Flask-SQLalchemy-microservice
This repository is the code base for a CRUD microservice that I have built using Flask web framework and SQLalchemy. The microservice allows to make APi calls to create product objects with fields: name, description, price, quantity and category ID. API calls can be made to delete, update and retrieve the created product.
